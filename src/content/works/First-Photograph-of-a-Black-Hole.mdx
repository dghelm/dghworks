description: 'On April 10, 2019, a team of international scientists unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole. Unlike iconic space photos before it, this image was made not with a camera and a lens, but a computer interpreting the radio waves received at observatories around the world. This piece utilizes their measurements and process to generate possible alternative images of the M87 black hole.'
