description: "In this Virtual Reality environment, the viewer gets to collaborate with a machile learning model to generate new images of towers. The piece is a tool without a clear purpose, lying somewhere between a creative tool for an artist, a sketching tool for an architect and an exploratory tool for educators. To exaggerate the virtual creation space, the user can publish their creations to the project's Instagram account alongside a photo of themself in the VR space."
