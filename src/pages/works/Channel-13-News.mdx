description: 'A recent study found that, at over 5,000 words, the “Terms of Use” for Instagram requires a postgraduate reading level to comprehend. The paragraph in this artwork was taken from an online chain letter recently posted to Instagram by many prominent celebrities, politicians, artists, and everyday people. The text first went viral on Facebook in 2012 and has since lived a life of reposting, copy-pasting, screenshotting and creative adaptation. Though the information the post contains is not factual, it points to fears and beliefs held by those who continue to share it.'
